Site reliability engineering is a software engineering approach to IT operations.

With SRE, 100% reliability is not expected; failure is planned for and accepted. 

SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams
who use software and automation to solve problems and production systems.

SRE helps teams find a balance between releasing new features and making sure that they are reliable for users.
SRE helps to improve the reliability of a system today, while also improving it as it grows over time. 

<--->

A site reliability engineer is a unique role that requires either a background as a software developer with additional operations experience, or as a sysadmin or in an IT operations role that also has software development skills. 

Automation is an important part of the site reliability engineerâ€™s role. If they are dealing with a problem repeatedly then they will automate a solution. This also helps ensure that operations work remains at half of their workload. 

Maintaining the balance between operations and development work is a key component of SRE.
